## Overview
FileCryp leverages blockchain technology and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to enable secure, tamper-proof file storage . Uploaded files are encrypted and distributed across the IPFS network. By integrating with MetaMask wallets, FileCryp manages permissions and verifies user identities via cryptographic signatures on chain.
Key features:
- Decentralized infrastructure based on IPFS
- Asymmetric encryption (AES-128) of IPFS file hashes before blockchain logging 
- MetaMask integration for key handling and access controls
- 7Zip compression of files prior to distribution
- Immutable ownership records on the blockchain

## Getting Started
To use FileCryp, you will need to install:
- [MetaMask browser extension](https://metamask.io/)
